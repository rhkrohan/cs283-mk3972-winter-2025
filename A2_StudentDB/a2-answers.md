## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**: 
    > I believe externalizing `get_student(...)` is a good design strategy because it isolates the logic for locating and reading a student record from the rest of the code. This modularity makes the code more readable, easier to maintain, and simplifies error handling by centralizing the logic for calculating file offsets and checking for empty records. It also promotes reuse of the function wherever a student lookup is needed.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** Returning a pointer to a local variable is a very bad idea because that variable is allocated on the stack and ceases to exist once the function returns. This means the caller would receive a pointer to memory that has been deallocated, leading to undefined behavior and potential runtime crashes. Such bugs can be extremely hard to trace because they may not appear immediately and can cause intermittent issues.


3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** Allocating the student record on the heap using `malloc()` would indeed allow the function to return a pointer that remains valid after the function exits, thus avoiding the issue of returning a pointer to a local variable. However, this approach introduces new responsibilities: the caller must remember to free the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks. In addition, if many such allocations occur without proper deallocation, it could lead to inefficient memory usage or fragmentation.



4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The file size reported by `ls` reflects the logical size of the file—that is, the offset of the highest written record plus the record size. For example, a student with ID=1 is stored at offset 64 (1 * 64) and occupies 64 bytes, so the file extends to 128 bytes. Similarly, a student with ID=3 is stored at offset 192 (3 * 64), yielding a file size of 256 bytes, and for ID=64, the record is at offset 4096, making the total logical size 4096 + 64 = 4160 bytes.


    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:**
        >  This is due to how Linux handles sparse files. The filesystem allocates disk storage in fixed-size blocks (commonly 4K). When records with lower IDs are added, they are stored within the same allocated block(s), so the physical disk usage remains unchanged. However, when adding a record for ID=64, it falls into a new block, forcing the filesystem to allocate an additional 4K block, thereby increasing the physical storage used from 4K to 8K.


    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:** Adding a student with a very large ID dramatically increases the logical file size because the record is written at a very high offset (99999 * 64 + 64). However, since the file is sparse, only the blocks that contain actual data are allocated on disk. The holes in the file—regions between the allocated blocks—do not consume physical disk space. Thus, even though the logical size is huge, the actual storage used remains minimal.
